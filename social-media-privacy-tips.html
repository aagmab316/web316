                        mainly in their leisure time, and even at work. In fact, the capability of social media offers numerous opportunities for interaction, but it is not without perils.

                        <strong> <span class="mainIcon">&#xf188; </span>  Privacy and security settings exist for a reason:</strong> Learn about and use the privacy and security settings on social networks. They are there to help you control who sees
                        what you post and manage your online experience in a positive way.
                    </p><br/>

                        <strong> <span class="mainIcon">&#xf185; </span>  Once posted, always posted:   </strong> Protect your reputation on social networks. What you post online stays online. Think twice before posting pictures you wouldn’t want your
                        parents or future employers to see.
                    </p>

                        <strong> <span class="mainIcon">&#xf108; </span>  Your online reputation can be a good thing: </strong> Recent research also found that recruiters respond to a strong, positive personal brand online. So show your smarts, thoughtfulness
                        and mastery of the environment.
                    </p>

                        <strong> <span class="mainIcon">&#xf084;  </span>  Keep personal info personal:</strong> Be cautious about how much personal information you provide on social networking sites. The more information you post, the easier it may be
                        for a hacker or someone else to use that information to steal your identity, access your data or commit other crimes such as stalking.</p>

                        <strong> <span class="mainIcon">&#xf0c0;  </span>  Know and manage your friends:</strong> Social networks can be used for a variety of purposes. Some of the fun is creating a large pool of friends from many aspects of your life.
                        That doesn’t mean all friends are created equal. Use tools to manage the information you share with friends in different groups or even have multiple online pages. If you’re trying to create a public persona as a blogger or expert,
                        create an open profile or a “fan” page that encourages broad participation and limits personal information. Use your personal profile to keep your real friends (the ones you know and trust) up to date with your daily life.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        <strong> <span class="mainIcon">&#xf127;  </span>  Be honest if you’re uncomfortable:</strong> If a friend posts something about you that makes you uncomfortable or seems inappropriate, let them know. Likewise, stay open minded
                        if a friend approaches you because something you’ve posted makes him or her uncomfortable. People have different tolerances for how much the world knows about them respect those differences.</p>

                    <p>
                        A cyber threat refers to a malicious act that seeks to damage data, steal information, or disrupt digital life in general. Cyber threats can be unintentional and intentional, targeted, or non-targeted, and they can come from several sources, including
                        hackers or cybercriminals. We categorize threats into two main groups,<br/></p> <br/>

                </div>
                <div class="eight columns">

                    <p> Hundreds of thousands of users use social media or social networking on a regular basis. For that reason, they have attracted the attention of attackers more than any other target in the last years. Privacy concerns require that users
                        never publish and share sensitive data over the web. This information can be utilized by criminals who use social engineering methods to obtain advantages of such information. In short, due to the high usage of social media, users
                        have been exposed to privacy and security threats. These threats include spam, clickjacking, malware, cyberstalking, phishing, inference attacks, or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The bad news is that these threats can spread
                        in a new and more quickly way than ever before.</p>

                    <p> <strong> <span class="mainIcon">&#xf11c; </span>  What is click jacking?</strong> Click jacking aka “UI redress attack” is an interface-based attack in which an attacker uses multiple transparent layers to trick a user into clicking
                        on actionable content on a hidden website by clicking on some other content in a decoy website. This can potentially open up numerous vulnerabilities: a user unintentionally downloading malware, visiting malicious web pages, or
                        providing credentials.

                    <p> <strong> <span class="mainIcon">&#xf188; </span>   What is an inference attack? </strong>Machine learning is becoming more and more powerful and easily accessible. Criminals are also aware of that and they increasingly leverage machine
                        learning to execute automated large-scale inference attacks in different domains. Inference attacks on social networks are executed with the help of machine learning algorithms to predict the sensitive or personal information of
                        a user that they may not want to disclose.

                    <p> <strong> <span class="mainIcon">&#xf086; </span>   What is cyberstalking?</strong> Cyberstalking means the use of social media, e-mail, or other telecommunication technologies to threaten, harass, or stalk users. So, cyberstalking
                        can be seen as an extension of the physical form of stalking. Cyberstalkers may send unsolicited e-mails, including hate, obscene or threatening mail, which presents a range of emotional and psychological damage for the victim.

                    <p> <strong> <span class="mainIcon">&#xf07e; </span>    What is a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack?</strong> Cross-site scripting is a vulnerable attack on web-based applications, in which malicious scripts are injected into trusted websites.
                        The actual attack takes place when the victim goes to the web page or web application that runs the malicious code. The web page or the application then turns into a vehicle to spread the malicious script to the user’s browser.
                        Depending on the severity of the XSS attack, user accounts may be hacked or Trojan horse programs activated.

                    <p>These threats include fake profiles, identity clone attacks, information, or location leakage. Social media is all about openly sharing information with friends. Some users voluntarily share their personal information on their social
                        media accounts. However, the sharing of such sensitive content may have adverse implications for social media users. Attackers impersonate their victims and send friend requests to the target with the aim to infiltrate his or her
                        private circle to steal information. Detecting traditional network attacks requires more sophisticated automated methods, and although there are a number of verification services, there is no proven defense for identity clone attacks

                    <p>
                        Online dating can be a good way to connect with potential romantic partners, but cybercriminals have started using this method in attempts to defraud unsuspecting victims. Here’s how the scam works. The fraudster usually strikes up a conversation on an
                        online dating site and begins an online relationship — but always comes up with reasons why he or she can’t meet up in person. Once the fraudster has gained the victim’s trust, they’ll ask for money or details about the victim’s
                        financial life. Victims of romance scams collectively lost more than $362 million in 2018. What to do? If you start an online relationship with someone, help protect yourself by asking a lot of questions. Take the relationship
                        slowly and never give financial information or money to someone you don’t know personally.

                    <h5 class="text-left">2. The overpayment scams</h5>
                    <p>

                        The transaction might seem legitimate at first. Someone responds to your online advertisement and arranges to pay for an item you’re selling. But the buyer invents a reason for sending you much more than the purchase price, then asks you to wire back
                        the difference before the money clears your bank account. After you’ve paid back the difference, it becomes clear the transferred money was fake — and you’re out the cash you gave the scammer. What to do? Be cautious. If someone
                        sends you a lot more money than you’re owed, it may be a scam. Don’t refund any money until the transfer is in your account. If you’re truly suspicious, you can also cancel the whole transaction and report this issue to the platform
                        where you’ve listed the online advertisement.

                    <h5 class="text-left">4. Quick-money promise</h5>
                    <p>
                        This scam might start out as a phone call, LinkedIn message, or unsolicited email that advertises a job requiring little to no real work, but offering lots of fast cash. Cybercriminals who practice this scam often target people looking for a new job or
                        wanting to work from home. But once you secure the job, you’re asked to fill out routine paperwork to provide your Social Security number, address, and bank information, seemingly for direct deposit of your paycheck. The fraudsters
                        can use this personal information to access your financial accounts. But there’s more. In some cases, you may unknowingly take part in a money-laundering scheme in your new role. The lesson? When job hunting, use well-known, reputable
                        job sites, research the employer, and avoid applying for positions that seem too good to be true.


                    </p> <br/>
                    <h5 class="text-left">5. Facebook impersonation scam</h5>
                    <p>
                        Facebook users may sometimes encounter scams. In one of the more recent examples, a fraudster copies the name, profile picture, and basic information from a real account to create a second, nearly identical account on Facebook. Next, the scammer sends
                        friend requests to the original account’s friend list in an attempt to access the personal information of the unsuspecting friends who grant access to their profiles. If you get a friend request from someone who should already
                        be on your friend list, search for their account. If you find two nearly identical accounts, it’s likely a sign that one of the accounts is fake. Report the cloned account to Facebook, and consider alerting your friend in real
                        life or on the phone so it’s clear who you’re talking to. Tip: In cases where you believe your account was hacked, first change your password or contact Facebook to investigate.

                    <h5 class="text-left">6. Fake shopping websites</h5>
                    <p>
                        Using sophisticated designs and layouts, cyberthieves may create and publish fake retailer websites that either look genuine or that replicate existing retailer websites. The bogus shopping sites might offer deals that are too good to be true, For instance,
                        you might find popular brands of clothing and expensive electronics at extra-low prices. And what if you buy? You may either receive the item and find out it’s fake, or you may receive nothing at all. If you think you’ve found
                        a fake shopping website, don’t spend money there. Instead, report the website to your country’s Cybercrime Complaint Centre.

                    <h5 class="text-left">7. Phishing scams</h5>
                    <p>
                        Phishing is a common scam, A fraudster will send you an email message that appears to be from a legitimate source, such as a bank, social networking site, or online store, for example. The message attempts to deceive you into providing valuable and sensitive
                        personal data, such as passwords, credit card numbers and bank account information. For instance, you might be directed to a website that looks legitimate, but was set up only to capture your information. The fraudulent emails
                        are usually written in an urgent tone. Often, they contain red flags such as misspellings, poor grammar, making urgent demands with threats of financial consequences, and logos that don’t quite look right. If you’re unsure whether
                        an email is legitimate or not, go directly to the company’s official website in a different tab — without clicking on links within the suspicious email.As a rule, never click on links from these emails, reply to the emails, attempt
                        to unsubscribe, or give out personal information.

                    </p> <br/>
                    <h5 class="text-left">8. Unexpected prize scam</h5>
                    <p>
                        This type of scam falls under the phishing category. The email may claim you’ve won a large chunk of cash, a free trip to an exotic destination, or some other fantastic prize. In order to claim your trip or winnings, the message will say, you only need
                        to pay a few small fees. After you pay those fees, you never hear from the organization again. Some travel scams may send you to the destination, but they’ve hidden a lot of important expenses such as visa fees, transportation
                        costs, or meals. The adage applies: If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Don’t respond to the message.

                    </p> <br/>
                    <h5 class="text-left">9. Exortion or threat or “hitman” scam</h5>
                    <p>
                        In another type of scam, the cybercriminal may threaten to embarrass or injure you or a family member unless a ransom is paid. The scammer may have gathered details about your life from social media profiles, which could make the claim seem more legitimate
                        or urgent. If you receive one of these messages, report it to your country’s Cybercrime Complaint Center and your local law enforcement.

                    </p> <br/>
                    <h5 class="text-left">10. Malware and ransomware scams</h5>
                    <p>
                        For cybercriminals, the first step in several types of scams is installing malware — short for “malicious software” — on a victim’s device. How? Criminals have a variety of deceptive ways to do this. For instance, the perpetrator may send you a pop-up
                        message for fake antivirus software, a link to a news article, or an email that looks like it’s from your bank. Clicking on the message or the embedded link triggers the installation of malware, which can be designed to scan your
                        device for personal and banking information, log your keystrokes, lock you out of your device, access your webcam, or even destroy your files in the process. Ransomware is a related form of malware that’s delivered through phishing
                        emails. Once the malware is installed on a device, the victim’s files are encrypted, and the cybercriminal demands a ransom payment, typically in a virtual currency such as bitcoin.The criminal promises to release the victim’s
                        files once the money is received, but often that doesn’t happen.
                    </p> <br/>
                    <h5 class="text-left">11. The tech support online scam</h5>
                    <p>
                        These types of scams can be related to or stem from malware infections. Fraudsters use urgent pop-up messages or fake online ads to promote software services. When you contact them, they’ll say you have a serious problem with your computer and will offer
                        tech support services you don’t need (because the problem doesn’t exist). They may also install malware on your device to gain access to your financial details. You may be able to tell it’s a scam from the company’s choice of payment
                        methods. For example, money sent via wire transfer, loaded on gift cards and prepaid cards, or transferred through an app like PayPal are hard to reverse. If the company seems suspicious and only takes these types of payments,
                        don’t do business with them and consider reporting the company to your country’s Cybercrime Complaint Center.

                    <p> You can file a complaint with your country’s Cybercrime Complaint Center or other government agency, which is the central point for tracking patterns of fraud and abuse related to internet crimes. The Center reviews complaints, analyzes
                        data, and creates intelligence reports that highlight emerging threats and new trends. Knowing how internet crimes work helps people understand the dangers involved and identify the fraud before falling prey to it. The center may
                        forward certain investigations to appropriate law enforcement agencies, which may bring legal action against the perpetrators.

                    <p>Some online accounts offer an extra layer of security known as multifactor authentication (also called two-factor authentication). This requires two or more credentials when you log in to an account. For instance, this can be a combination
                        of a password plus something you have (such as an additional passcode sent to your phone) or something you are (such as fingerprint or facial recognition). So, if a scammer does get your username and password, multifactor authentication

                    <h6 class="text-left"><strong><span class="mainIcon">&#xf00c; </span> Don’t respond to scam messages </strong></h6>
                    <p> A response could lead to various consequences, such as triggering a malware installation or confirming your phone number or email address are working. Instead, make a copy of records that may help investigators and delete other emails,
                        texts and social media messages that look and sound like a scam. Don’t click on links, open attachments, reply to the message, attempt to unsubscribe, or call any telephone number listed in suspicious messages. And don’t give out
                        any money, credit card details, or other personal details.

                    <h6 class="text-left"><strong><span class="mainIcon">&#xf00c; </span> Install antivirus software</strong></h6>
                    <p>
                        Antivirus, or security software is designed to prevent malware from embedding on your computer or device. If the software detects malicious code, like a virus or a worm, it works to disarm or remove it. This could help protect your devices if you accidentally
                        click a dangerous link. The antivirus software can fight the malware and safeguard your files. Always be sure you download software apps and services only from official vendor sites.

                    <h6 class="text-left"><strong><span class="mainIcon">&#xf00c; </span> Back up your data</strong> </h6>
                    <p> It’s a good idea to regularly make copies of your data in case it’s compromised in a malware attack. The backups should be copied to an external hard drive or cloud storage and not your home network. Back up the data on all your devices,
                        including your smartphone. </p><br/>
                    <h6 class="text-left"><strong><span class="mainIcon">&#xf00c; </span> Don’t trust unsolicited phone calls or emails</strong></h6>
                    <p>If someone calls or emails claiming to be a tech expert, don’t accept help, give out personal or financial information, or allow them to remotely access your computer. Instead, ask for proof of identity and research the company.</p>
