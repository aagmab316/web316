                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Having a routine cyber hygiene procedure in place for your computers and software is beneficial for two distinct reasons – maintenance and security. Maintenance is necessary for computers and software to run at peak efficiency.
                    </p>
                    <p>Files become fragmented and programs become outdated, increasing the risk of vulnerabilities. Routines that include maintenance are likely to spot many of these issues early and prevent serious issues from occurring. A system that
                        is well-maintained is less likely to be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks. Security is perhaps the most important reason to incorporate a cyber hygiene routine.</p>
                    <p>
                        Hackers, identity thieves, advanced viruses, and intelligent malware are all part of the hostile threat landscape. While predicting threats can be challenging, preparing and preventing them becomes feasible with sound cyber hygiene practices.

                        Enterprises often have multiple elements in need of cyber hygiene. All hardware (computers, phones, connected devices), software programs, and online applications used should be included in a regular, ongoing maintenance program. Each of these systems
                        have specific vulnerabilities that can lead to different problems. Some of these problems include:

                    <h6 class="text-left"> 1. Protect your computer network with secure routers with robust firewalls. While traveling, use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and/or software firewall.</h6>
                    <p>
                        The 1st line of cyber defense in computer network security is to install and maintain a secure Internet Protocol (IP) router and a robust firewall that prevents unauthorized users from accessing data, email, applications, web browsers, etc. If you are
                        a computer system administrator: install and configure a secure commerical IP router, white list all approved users, black list all unknown users, and ensure that the wireless (WiFi) communications use WPA2/WPA3 encryption for
                        wireless comunications. If you are traveling away from your business or home computer network, ensure that you are using a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) and/or your Operating System (OS) has a secure software firewall turned
                        on.
                    </p><br/>
                    <h6 class="text-left"> 2. Install dependable anti-virus (AV) and anti-malware software that continuously scans your computer/mobile phone, and update it frequently</h6>
                    <p>
                        The 2nd line of cyber defense in computer network security is to install and maintain robust anti-virus (AV) and anti-malware software that scans and terminates computer viruses and other kinds of malicious sofware (malware). If possible, install a robust
                        commercial Intrusion Protection Device/Intrusion Protection Device product; if you are a home computer user ensure that you install either a commercial or FOSS (Free &Open Source Software) AV software product.
                    </p><br/>
                    <h6 class="text-left"> 3. Update all OS, Web Browser and Application software with security patches in a timely manner.</h6>
                    <p>
                        The 3rd line of cyber defense in computer network security is to update all Operating System (OS), web browser, and application software regularly to ensure that security patches are properly installed in a timely manner. These security patches are essential
                        to make sure that all currently-known cybersecurity vulnerabilities have been closed.
                    </p><br/>
                    <h6 class="text-left"> 4. Define strong passwords and use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) whenever available</h6>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span> Define strong passwords that are unique and complex: 12+ characters, combo of lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special chars (e.g., !@#$%^&*).</p>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span> Do not share passwords, change them regularly (say every 3 months), and do not share the same passwords.</p>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span> Use 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which adds an additional layer of security to passwords, wherever practical, especially to financial, health, and other confidential accounts.
                        2FA and MFA greatly increases security by corroborating your password with additional information such as a unique pin, biometrics (facial or fingerprint recognition), secondary device (e.g., a personal mobile phone can corroborate
                        web browser password login on a desktop computer).</p><br/>
                    <h6 class="text-left">5. Practice safe web browsing habits</h6>
                    <p>Since many commercial companies seek to harvest personal data it is essential that you practice safe web browsing habits which include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span>Configure your web browsers' privacy and security settings to block third party cookies, not save passwords, not autocomplete, and not save search histories. </P>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span> Set your default web browser search engine to a choice that does not track your query content and habits, for example, DuckDuckGo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span> Set your default web browse to a choice that fully complies with current W3C standards and supports security plugins. For example, Free &Open-Source Software (FOSS) Firefox fully complies with W3C web standards and
                        supports the following security plugins:</p>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span><strong> HTTPS Everywhere</strong> The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and The Tor Project jointly developed this Firefox, Chrome, and Opera extension to support the secure HTTPS communications protocol vs. the
                        standard HTTP protocol, which is more widely used but less secure. (The ‘S’ in HTTPS stands for ‘secure.’) HTTPS Everywhere encrypts communications with many major websites to help secure your browsing experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span> <strong> Web of Trust (a.k.a. WOT).</strong> This extension for FireFox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, and Opera helps determine if a website is safe to surf. The extension displays traffic signal icons next
                        to URLs and links. Green means the site is reliable; yellow indicates you should proceed with caution; red translates to “steer clear.” The ratings are crowdsourced from WOT’s global user base and are supported by trusted third-party
                        sources, such as up-to-date directories of malware sites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span> Check out shortened links from a non-trusted source prior to clicking on them, since they have been known to mask malicious links. Check out via ExpandURL or CheckShort URL online utilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span> Only visit web sites with via HTTPS ( HTTP Secure) protocol and ensure that the web site's SSL Certificate is valid. Typically, the web URL will begin with "https://…" and the web browser will show a "padlock" icon
                        if the site's SSL certificate is valid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span> Beware when installing web browser plugins from unknown/untrusted sources. All plugins should be simple and single-purpose in nature; complex, multi-function plugins that are not properly maintained can increase
                        cyber-attack surfaces to exploit.
                    </p> <br/>
                    <h6 class="text-left"> 6. Practice safe email habits </h6>
                    <p> Consider that most free commercial email services (GMail, Outlook.com, iCloud Mail, Yahoo Mail, GMX Mail etc.) compromise your privacy to serve targeted ads or otherwise exploit your personal data, it is essential that you practice
                        safe email habits, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span> Beware of spear fishing emails from unknown/untrusted sources that may link to or contain malware! Do not click on a link or open an attachment from an unknown/untrusted source. Delete and purge subject email and
                        blacklist the sender.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span> Do not include sensitive or confidential information (e.g., financial, health) in your email subject, content or plaintext (unencrypted text, a.k.a. clear text) attachment. If you need to send sensitive or secure
                        information via email, encrypt it as an attachment, and send the password via an alternative mechanism (e.g., voice communication, SMS/MMS text message, separate email).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span> Consider a secure email service, with end-to-end encryption to ensure that your email content remains private.

                    <h6 class="text-left"> 7. Keep your user data separate from applications, and apply strong encryption to all sensitive and confidential data</h6>
                    <p>
                        Keep all user data separate from user applications, and keep personal data separate from business data. Apply strong encryption (AES-256 bit or higher) with strong passwords to all sensitive and confidential data including, but not limited to, financial
                        and health data.

                        You should be especially wary when buying goods or services online, especially when it is unknown/untrusted source. In general, you should:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span>></span> Check the website is secure. Check that the website URL starts with the letters “HTTPS://” and has an image of a small "padlock", usually in the top left-hand corner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>></span> Select your item(s) you wish to purchase, add them to your Shopping Cart temporary storage, and proceed to the Check Out page to pay.

                    <p>
                        When selling or disposing of your desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone or USB drive, it’s critical that you securely wipe (erase) all personal, sensitive and confidential data. Deleting files alone is insufficient, since they frequently can be recovered
                        by hackers and forensic specialists.

                <p>
                    One of the biggest challenges High Touch faces is navigating the unawareness of general cybersecurity best practices. Through providing cybersecurity services, we’ve noticed that many cyberattacks are initiated after a hacker finds a way to steal an employee’s
                    username and password. Once a hacker has access to a system, they can sit back and wait until they have a perfect, lucrative opportunity to execute an attack. With proper cybersecurity education and best practices in place, businesses
                    can help protect themselves from commonly executed cyberattacks.

                    Ransomware is always one of our biggest concerns. Recently, we’ve also been concerned with monitoring and preventing lateral phishing takeover attacks. Through these types of cyberattacks, hackers gain access to an employee’s email account. Then, they
                    set up rules to extract valuable data and information. Once hackers find a piece of information they can exploit, they use it to create a genuine-looking email to everyone in the employee’s address book. With advanced technologies
                    and machine learning, hackers can make phishing emails look frighteningly legitimate. As other employees open and interact with the email, hackers gain access to more data and information until the entire organization is affected.

                    Cybersecurity implementations and processes are most effective when organizations diligently practice good cyber hygiene habits while concurrently checking their cyber defense vulnerabilities defenses via aggressive white hat" (a.k.a. "ethical hacking")
                    Penetration Testing ("pen testing").

                <p>

                    A cyber-attack is an attempt to disable computers, steal data, or use a breached computer system to launch additional attacks. Cybercriminals can use a variety of methods to launch a cyber-attack including malware, phishing, ransomware, man-in-the-middle
                    attack, and other methods.

            <div class="content">



                <p> The term cyber defense, along with the related term cyber countermeasure, are defined as follows: Cyber defense: Activates intended to eliminate or mitigate the effects of a cyber attack. Cyber defense is based on the following core principles:
                </p>

                <p><span>></span> Confidentiality: Information that is secret, classified, private or otherwise sensitive must remain so and be shared only with appropriate users.</p>
                <p><span>></span> Integrity: Information must retain its wholeness and not be altered from its original state.</p>
                <p><span>></span> Availability: Information must be accessible to those who are authorized with a "need to know".</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>


                    Perimeter-based cybersecurity refers to the passive cyber defense of static networks by making network external boundaries impenetrable (unbreachable). Common perimeter-based cybersecurity technologies include, but are not limited to, firewalls, anti-virus
                    software, anti-malware scanners, etc.

            <button type="button" class="collapsible"> What is a firewall and how does it work?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>


                    a firewall is a network security system that monitors incoming and outgoing network message traffic and prevents the transmission of malicious messages based on an updatable rule set. In effect, a firewall establishes a barrier between a trusted, secure
                    internal network and external networks (e.g., the Internet) that are assumed to be untrustworthy and non-secure. Firewalls can be implemented as software that runs on general-purpose hardware (e.g., an open-source firewall on a Windows
                    PC or Mac OS X computer) or a dedicated hardware device (appliance). How does a firewall work? Firewalls function as a filter between a trusted, secure internal network and external networks (e.g., the Internet) that are assumed to
                    be untrustworthy and non-secure. The firewall filter may be flexibly programmed to control what information packets are allowed and blocked.

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">   What is anti-virus software and how does it work?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>




                    <p> Anti-virus software is computer software used to scan files to identify and eliminate malicious software (malware). Although anti-virus software was originally developed to detect and remove computer viruses (hence its name), it has
                        been broadened in scope to detect other malware, such as worms, Trojan horses, adware, spyware, ransomware, etc.</p>

                    <p> How does anti-virus software work? Anti-virus software typically uses two different techniques to identify and eliminate malware:</p>

                    <p><span>></span> Virus dictionary approach: The anti-virus software scans a file while referring to a dictionary of known virus signatures that have been previously identified. If a code segment in the file matches any virus signature
                        in the virus dictionary, then the anti-virus software performs one or more of the following operations: deletes the file; quarantines the file so that it is unable to spread; or attempts to repair the file by removing the virus
                        from the file.</p>
                    <p><span>></span> Suspicious behavior approach: The anti-virus software monitors the behavior of all programs, flagging suspicious behavior, such as one executing program attempting to write date to another executable program. The user
                        is alerted to all suspicious behavior, and is queried regarding how the suspicious behavior should be handled.</p>

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">   What is a Moving Target Defense (MTD) for cybersecurity?</button>
            <div class="content">

                <p> In the context of cybersecurity, Moving Target Defense (MTD) refers to the dynamic cyber defense of active networks with constantly changing attack surfaces. Since the MTD network attack surfaces are constantly changing, they are inherently
                    more difficult for cyber attackers to probe and penetrate. MTD is based on the principle that cyber attackers cannot effectively "hit" (penetrate) what they cannot capably "see" (probe).

            <button type="button" class="collapsible">  What is a Next Generation FireWall (NGFW)?</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>

                    A Next-Generation FireWall (NGFW) is the 3rd-generation of firewall technology that extends a traditional stateful network firewall with additional network device filtering functions. Stateful (2nd-generation) firewalls track the operating state of a
                    computer network and the characteristics of network connections that traverse it. Stateful firewalls filter network packets, so that only packets matching a known, active connection are allowed to pass the firewall. In addition to
                    packet filtering, other functions of stateful firewalls include Network—and port—Address Translation (NAT) and Virtual Private Network (VPN) support. Additional NGFW network device filtering functions may include, but are not limited
                    to, Anti-Virus (AV) inspection, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) filtering, TLS/SSL encrypted traffic inspection, website filtering, QoS/bandwidth management, etc.
