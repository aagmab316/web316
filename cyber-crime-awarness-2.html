                                        by human negligence. Therefore, Cybercrime awareness is important for everyone today. We must be vigilant while making use of technology to reduce the risk of cyber threats.

                                Phishing attacks are the most common method that cybercriminals use to gain access to an organization’s network. They take advantage of human nature to trick their target into falling for the scam by offering some incentive (free stuff, a business opportunity
                                and so on) or creating a sense of urgency. Phishing awareness is a main component of Cybersecurity awareness program. This includes examples of common and relevant phishing emails and tips for identifying attempted attacks.

                                Malware is malicious software that cybercriminals use to steal sensitive data (user credentials, financial information and so on) or cause damage to an organization’s systems (e.g., ransomware and wiper malware). It can be delivered to an organization
                                in a number of different ways, including phishing emails, drive-by downloads and malicious removable media. Corporate security awareness program covers common delivery methods, threats and impacts to the organization. Important

                                Passwords are the most common and easiest-to-use authentication system in existence. Most employees have dozens of online accounts that are accessed by providing a username (often their email address) and a password. Poor password security is one of the
                                biggest threats to modern enterprise security. Most important password security tips are included in awareness program.

                                Removable media (such as USBs, CDs and so on) are a useful tool for cybercriminals since they enable malware to bypass an organization’s network-based security defenses. Malware can be installed on the media and configured to execute automatically with
                                Autorun or have an enticing filename to trick employees into clicking. Malicious removable media can steal data, install ransomware or even destroy the computer they’re inserted into. Malicious removable media can be distributed
                                by being dropped in parking lots and common areas or being handed out at conferences and other public events. Employees should be aware to properly manage untrusted removable media.

                            <p> Enterprises use social networking as a powerful tool to build a brand (either locally or globally) and generate online sales. Unfortunately, cybercriminals also use social media for attacks that put an organization’s systems

                            </p>
                            <p> To prevent the loss of critical data, the enterprise must have a viable social networking awareness that should limit the use of social networking and inform employees of the threats of social media. SBR awareness program incorporates

                            <h6 class="text-left"> Why public security awareness is a must</h6>

                            <p> Advanced technologies have changed the modern way of life. The internet provides us with many benefits. Be it communicating with friends, searching for information, doing banking transactions, availing online services, finding
                                job, finding life partner or even running entire businesses. The internet touches almost all aspects of our lives. However, it also makes us vulnerable to a wide range of threats.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                New and powerful cyber-attacks are striking the internet regularly. A minor lapse in managing our digital lives can open the door to cyber criminals. Cyber criminals can steal our money or damage our reputation. According to a study by a leading industry
                                research organization, 90% of all cyberattacks are caused by human negligence. Therefore, cyber security awareness is important for everyone today.
                            </p>
                            <p> We must be vigilant while making use of technology to reduce the risk of cyber threats.
                            </p>
                            <p> We provide our awareness services for users incorporating but not limited to the below elements into it:
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <strong>    Identity Theft</strong>
                            <p> Identity theft is the act of wrongfully obtaining someone’s personal information (that defines one’s identity) without their permission. The personal information may include their name, phone number, address, bank account number
                                or credit/debit card number etc.
                            </p>
                            <p> Identity theft can have many adverse effects. The fraudster can use stolen personal information and identity proofs to:
                            </p>
                            <p><span>></span> gain access to your bank accounts</p>
                            <p><span>></span> apply for loans and credit cards or open insurance accounts</p>
                            <p><span>></span> obtain a driver’s license, passport or immigration papers</p>
                            <p><span>></span> create new utility accounts</p>
                            <p><span>></span> get medical treatment on your health insurance</p>
                            <p><span>></span> assume your identity on social media</p>
                            <br/>
                            <strong>  Digital Banking Frauds</strong>
                            <p> Digital Banking Fraud is a fraud or theft committed using online technology to illegally remove money from a bank account and/or transfer money to an account in a different bank. Internet Banking Fraud is a form of identity
                                theft and is usually made possible through techniques such as phishing.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <strong> Psychological Tricks</strong>
                            <p> Psychological tricks are where attackers play with the minds of the user to trap them with lucrative offers. Once trapped, the attackers can exploit you by either stealing money or stealing sensitive personal information (name,
                                bank account details etc.) or harm you in any other way. The entire basis of this kind of attack is to make you fall into their trap by sending fake e-mails, calls or SMSs.
                            </p>
                            <br/>
                            <strong> Attacks through Mobile Applications </strong>
                            <p> With the increase in the use of smartphones and the consequent rise in the use of mobile applications, associated security risks have also increased. The number of mobile transactions has increased four times in the last couple
                                of years, and now, cyber criminals are targeting mobile users to extract data and money.
                            </p>
                            <p> Mobile applications are widely used not only for entertainment but also for ease and convenience to perform day-to-day tasks such as bill payments, bank accounts management, service delivery etc. As a result, these applications
                                are more prone to cyber-attacks. Users need to be aware of such attacks on commonly used mobile applications such as digital payment applications and gaming applications.
                            </p> <br/>
                            <strong> Social Media related Attacks</strong>
                            <p> Social Media has become an integral part of our lives. It is the new way of communicating, sharing and informing people about the events in our lives. We share our day to day lives on social media in the form of self and family
                                photographs, updates on our locations/whereabouts, our views/thoughts on prevalent topics etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One can understand the entire history of an individual through their social media profile and can even predict future events based on patterns in the past. This poses a threat to an individual as unwanted access to social media profile can cause loss
                                of information, defamation or even worse consequences such as physical assault, robbery etc. Hence, protection and appropriate use of social media profile is very important.
                            </p> <br/>
                            <strong>   Virus Attacks on Personal end point devices</strong>
                            <p> Personal Computers, laptops tablets and mobile phones play a very important role in our lives. We store our crucial information such as bank account numbers, business documents etc. in them. We also store personal files like
                                photos, music, movies etc. in the computer. Therefore, protection of all this data is highly essential.</p>
                            <p> Just as we keep a physical lock on our safe vaults, it is equally important to protect our valuable data from viruses/malicious applications that can damage it.
                            </p>
